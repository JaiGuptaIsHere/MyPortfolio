This is the first project I made as a part of my learning journey in the domain of Web Development. The portfolio website is made from vanilla frontend components like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is made highly responsive and attractive with the use of CSS styles and JS logic. It is divided into a number of portions like Home, Education, and Projects. I took inspiration from a number of online tutorials to come up with this project.
